# MScProjects
A couple of projects from my MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford.

## FakeNewsDetection

## PhDPublications
Given a dataset detailing various characteristics of PhD students, the goal of this project was to build a (Poisson) Generalised Linear Model which predicts the number of publications the student will produce in the final year of their degree. The final report is given in GLM_Report.pdf, with the associated code in GLM.R.
